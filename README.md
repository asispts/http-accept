`http-accept` is a PHP library for parsing HTTP headers used in content negotiation. It supports the following headers:
- `Accept`
- `Accept-Language`
- `Accept-Encoding`
- `Content-Type`

Parser classes are provided for each header, making it straightforward to extract information from incoming requests.


## Installation

```bash
composer require asispts/http-accept
```

## Usage

### Parse `Content-Type`

```

### Parse HTTP `Accept`

```

### Parse `Accept-Language`
